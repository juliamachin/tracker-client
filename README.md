# Sub.tle
## A discreet way to take charge of your personal health needs.
### Project Overview
The inspiratiion behind Sub.tle, besides the not so subtle name is manage and track your menstrual cycle in a more private way. For years now, companies have been buying and selling personal data from period tracking apps for profit, meaning, the ads you're seeing could be directed at you based on where you're at in your cycle. Invasive, right? So I want to create a simple, gender-neutral period tracker that's doesn't require you're personal information.
